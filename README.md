# blueprint-gen

*This is a quick demo for a new blueprint tool for Lean. It is currently completely in proof-of-concept stage.*

Blueprint-gen is a tool for generating the blueprint data of a Lean project directly from Lean.

The blueprint is a high-level plan of a Lean project, consisting of a series of nodes (theorems and definitions) and the dependency relations between them.
The purpose of blueprint-gen is to make it easier to write the blueprint by generating blueprint data directly from Lean.

Nodes are declared in Lean by the `@[blueprint]` tag. They are exported to LaTeX, which you may then put in the blueprint.

This tool is built to complement [leanblueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint) and its structure is inspired by [doc-gen4](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4). The idea is inspired by [leanblueprint-extract](https://github.com/AlexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/tree/main/leanblueprint-extract).

## Example

Consider the following `MyNat` API:

```lean
/-! # Natural numbers -/

@[blueprint "Natural numbers"]
inductive MyNat : Type where
  | zero : MyNat
  | succ : MyNat â†’ MyNat

namespace MyNat

/-!
## Addition
Here we define addition of natural numbers.
-/

/-- Natural number addition. -/
@[blueprint]
def add (a b : MyNat) : MyNat :=
  match b with
  | zero => a
  | succ b => succ (add a b)

/-- For any natural number $a$, $0 + a = a$, where $+$ is Def. `MyNat.add`. -/
@[blueprint, simp]
theorem zero_add (a : MyNat) : add zero a = a := by
  /-- The proof follows by induction. -/
  induction a <;> simp [*, add]

/-- For any natural numbers $a, b$, $(a + 1) + b = (a + b) + 1$. -/
@[blueprint]
theorem succ_add (a b : MyNat) : add (succ a) b = succ (add a b) := by
  /-- Proof by induction on `b`. -/
  -- If the proof contains sorry, the `\leanok` command will not be added
  sorry

/-- For any natural numbers $a, b$, $a + b = b + a$. -/
@[blueprint]
theorem add_comm (a b : MyNat) : add a b = add b a := by
  induction b with
  | zero =>
    -- The inline code `abc` is converted to \ref{abc} if possible.
    /-- The base case follows from `MyNat.zero_add`. -/
    simp [add]
  | succ b ih =>
    /-- The inductive case follows from `MyNat.succ_add`. -/
    using succ_add  -- the `using` tactic declares that the proof uses succ_add
    sorry

-- Additional content omitted

end MyNat
```

The output of the above example is:

With depedency graph:

## Specifying the blueprint

After tagging with `@[blueprint]`, blueprint-gen will:

1. Extract the statement and proof of a node from docstrings.
2. Infer the dependencies of a node from the constants used in the statement or proof.
3. Infer whether the statement or proof is ready (i.e. `\leanok`) from whether it is sorry-free.
4. Add the node to the generated blueprint.

You may override the constants used in the statement or proof with the `uses` and `proofUses` options, or with the `using` tactic.

To view the generated blueprint data of a node, use `@[blueprint?]`.

## Generating the blueprint

First, install [leanblueprint](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint) and follow the instructions there to set up a blueprint project, if not already done.

To generate the blueprint for a module, first input the generated blueprint to the blueprint document:

```latex
% Typically, in blueprint/src/content.tex

\input{../../.lake/build/blueprint/library/Example}

% Input the blueprint contents of module `Example.MyNat`:
\inputleanmodule{Example.MyNat}

% You may also input only a single node using \inputleannode{MyNat.add}.
```

Then run:

```sh
# Generate the blueprint to .lake/build/blueprint
lake build :blueprint
# Build the blueprint using leanblueprint
leanblueprint pdf
leanblueprint web
```

You may also want to put this in the GitHub Actions workflow typically at `.github/workflows/blueprint.yml`:

```yaml
      # Before "Build blueprint and copy to `home_page/blueprint`":
      - name: Extract blueprint
        run: ~/.elan/bin/lake build :blueprint
```

## Converting from existing blueprint format

With a project that uses the existing leanblueprint format:

First go to a clean branch without any uncomitted changes, to prevent overwriting any work you have done.

You can then convert to blueprint-gen format by adding `blueprint-gen` as a dependency to lakefile, run `lake update blueprint-gen`, and then run:

```sh
# TODO, make this into lake exe
# At the project root
python .lake/packages/blueprint-gen/scripts/convert/main.py --modules {root modules of your project}
```

Then you would need to fix the errors in the converted files. You would also need to manually add the nodes that are not in the project itself (typically, `\mathlibok` nodes) to the blueprint, which will be saved to `extra_nodes.lean`.

## Extracting nodes in JSON

To extract the blueprint nodes in machine-readable format, run:

```sh
lake build :blueprintJson
```

The output will be in `.lake/build/blueprint`.
